# Clarity-TDD-Demo
This is demo / template for developing Clarity contracts with TDD.

Originally started from [official docs](https://github.com/clarity-lang/overview).

## Testing with jest
```
yarn test
```

## VScode Extension for M1 Mac. (WIP)
https://github.com/hirosystems/clarity-lsp/issues/34.

I build it locally and install it with `Install from VSIX`. But not working.
